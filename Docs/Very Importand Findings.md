# Very Importand Findings

- #### Lighthouse Tracked Devices need a battery.
Without connected battery, tracking may not work properly or not at all.

This is especially noticable in VR Headsets as those will fail to boot into VR.

- #### Tracking will not work at all without Sensor Covers
Lighthouse Tracked Device need semi-transparent covers over the IR Sensors.

Without proper covers, there will be too much interference and tracking will fail.

- #### IR Sensors are 850nm
This means that direct sunlight or even heat from a radiator will cause them to not work as intended
